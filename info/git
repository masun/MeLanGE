    Fix segmentation faults in test_clear.py.
    
    On OS X at least, test_clear.py often, but not always segfaulted. Debugging
    showed that this was because node_attr and the like were using a
    handle value that had already been closed. Now, we update these
    attributes to use the current, correct, handle, after it has been
    re-opened.
